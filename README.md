# 💊 MEDICA AI: Revolutionizing Pharmaceutical Inventory Management

### An intelligent AI-powered solution to prevent medicine expiry and shortages in healthcare facilities

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Pharmaceutical supply chains face **two critical, interconnected challenges** that cost the healthcare industry **billions annually**:

### 🧪 Medicine Expiry
- 💸 Over **$6 billion worth** of medicines are discarded annually due to expiration.  
- ⚠️ Results in substantial financial losses and environmental waste.

### 💉 Medicine Shortages
- ⏱️ Frequent and unpredictable shortages disrupt patient care.  
- 🏥 Force providers to use less effective alternatives or delay treatment.

> **Root Cause:** Ineffective manual inventory management that ignores dynamic factors like demand variation, supplier delays, medicine shelf life, and shortage alerts — leading to both **overstock and understock**.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### 1. Enhanced Predictability and Proactive Decision-Making
- 📈 Achieve **>90% forecast accuracy** for fast-moving items and **>75%** for slow-moving ones.  
- ⚡ Flag **85%+ of potential stockouts and expiries** at least 3 months in advance.  
- 🧠 Generate **daily actionable insights** for pharmacists.

### 2. Optimized Inventory Efficiency
- ♻️ Reduce **expired drug volume by 30%** within the first year.  
- 🚫 Cut **stockouts of critical medicines by 50%**.  
- 📊 Improve overall **inventory turnover ratio**.

### 3. Maximized Usability and Trust
- 👩‍⚕️ Reach **90% user adoption** within 6 months.  
- 🗣️ Provide **plain-language reasoning** for recommendations.  
- 🕒 Reduce manual planning time by **50%**.

## 📊 Business Impact Visualization

![Business Impact Overview](docs/diagrams/medica-impact-diagram.png)  
*Figure 1: How Medica AI transforms losses from expiry and shortages into sustainable operational gains.*

---

## 📏 Key Performance Indicator: *Expiry-Adjusted Service Level*

A metric balancing **availability** and **waste reduction**.

\[
\text{Expiry-Adjusted Service Level (\%)} = \frac{\text{Units Sold}}{\text{Units Sold + Units Stock-Out + Units Expired}} \times 100
\]

| Metric | Before Medica AI | After Medica AI |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Units Sold | 9,500 | **9,800** |
| Units Stock-Out | 500 | **150** |
| Units Expired | 1,000 | **200** |
| Service Level | 86.4% | **96.6%** ✅ |

> 📊 **+10.2% improvement** → More patients served, less waste, fewer shortages.

## 🧬 Data Sources

To predict demand, detect risks, and optimize ordering, Medica AI integrates **internal** and **external** data streams:

### 🏥 Internal Sources
- Pharmacy Information Systems  
- Historical sales & dispensing data  
- Real-time inventory levels  
- Batch-level data (expiry dates, batch IDs)  
- Supplier performance & purchase history  

### 🌐 External Sources
- **Public Health Data:** Disease trends, outbreak alerts  
- **Regulatory Data:** FDA Drug Shortages Database  
- **Supplier Feeds:** Distributor stock levels, lead times, and allocations

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](docs/diagrams/medica-architecture.png)  
*Figure 2: End-to-end Medica AI system architecture — from data ingestion and model training to real-time prediction and pharmacist dashboard.*

### Key Components
- **Data Ingestion Layer:** ETL pipeline combining internal & external data feeds  
- **Modeling Layer:** XGBoost model with SHAP explainability  
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for structured data and S3 for logs  
- **API Layer:** FastAPI for prediction serving  
- **Monitoring Layer:** Automated drift detection and retraining triggers  
- **User Interface:** Streamlit / Power BI dashboards for pharmacy staff  

---

## 🧠 Chosen Model: XGBoost

### Why XGBoost?
| Strength | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| ⚙️ Performance | Excels on tabular, heterogeneous data |
| 🛡️ Robustness | Handles missing values and noisy records |
| 🔍 Interpretability | Uses SHAP values for transparent explanations |
| ⚡ Efficiency | Low-latency predictions across thousands of SKUs |

---

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

![Data Pipeline Diagram](docs/diagrams/data-pipeline.png)  
*Figure 3: Data preprocessing pipeline ensuring clean, aligned, and domain-aware datasets for training and prediction.*

1. **Temporal Alignment:** Synchronize all time-based data sources.  
2. **Domain-Aware Imputation:** Handle missing data using context-driven logic.  
3. **Normalization & Encoding:** Scaling, target encoding, and cyclical transformations.  

---

## ⚖️ Bias & Ethical Considerations

### 🧩 Digital Footprint Bias
Offline pharmacist decisions (e.g., medication substitution) might not be digitally captured — potentially distorting demand signals.  
**Mitigation:** Combine digital data with contextual feedback loops.

### 🔁 Algorithmic Feedback Loop
Predicting shortages can cause **collective over-ordering**, ironically creating the very shortage predicted.  
**Mitigation:** Controlled ordering policies and regional smoothing.

---

## 📈 Evaluation & Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **F2-Score (Risk Classification):** Prioritizes recall to capture true risks.  
- **Pinball Loss (Forecasting):** Measures accuracy of probabilistic forecasts.

### Continuous Monitoring
![Monitoring Workflow](docs/diagrams/model-monitoring.png)  
*Figure 4: Continuous monitoring loop for drift detection and model retraining.*

- 🧭 **Concept Drift:** Monitor F2-Score and Pinball Loss over time  
- ⚙️ **Data Drift:** Apply KS Test, PSI, Chi-Square on live data streams  
- 🧪 **Canary Drugs:** Early-warning subset of key medications  

**Remediation Workflow:**  
`Alert → Diagnose → Retrain → Validate → Redeploy`
